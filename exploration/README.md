# Exploration

Intuition-building and data validation!

## Raw

Data exploration done on single traces before the data were loaded:

`single_trace_level_data_exploration.ipynb`: Descriptive statistics

`entity_timelines.ipynb`: A day in the life of a Tor Hidden Service traffic trace

(`raw_util.py` contains a loading function for a raw trace)

## Loaded

Exploration using the populated database:

`validation_rendezvous_circuits.ipynb`: exploring the rendezvous circuits

`validation_general_traces.ipynb`: examining the final command in each trace, the typical duration of traces
